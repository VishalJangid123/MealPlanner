Welcome to the **MealMap**! 🥳 This mobile application helps you easily plan, organize, and manage your meals for up to **three weeks**. Whether you’re looking to simplify your meal prep, stick to a healthy routine, or just stay organized, this app makes meal planning a breeze.

Developed with **React Native** using **Expo**, and powered by **MongoDB**, this app ensures a seamless experience across both Android and iOS devices.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project was to **learn and practice React Native** by building a practical, real-world application. The project allowed me to get hands-on experience with mobile app development, backend API creation, and working with MongoDB.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: **React Native** & **Expo** – Framework and toolkit for building cross-platform mobile apps.
- **Backend**: **Express.js** – Web framework for creating APIs.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** – Database for storing meal plans.
- **API Requests**: **Axios** – HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** – NativeWind.
- **Routing**: **Expo Router** – For navigation between app screens.

## 🏁 Installation

To get started with the **Meal Planner App** locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/meal-planner-app.git
    
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd MealPlanner
    ```
    
3. **Install dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    
    ```
    
4. **Start the development server:**
    
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    
5. **Run the app on your device or emulator.**

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. **Home Screen**

When you first enter the app, you’ll see a **3-week calendar** with each day showing any existing meal plans. If no meal is added yet, it will appear as empty. Simply tap on a date to get started!

### 2. **Meal Menu Screen**

Tapping a date on the home screen takes you to the **meal menu** for that day. If there’s already a meal planned, it will be shown. You can add new meals by selecting **meal type**, **dish type**, and entering a **dish name**.

### 3. **Delete Meal Plans**

If you want to remove a meal plan, you can do so directly from the **home screen** or the **meal menu screen** by selecting the "delete" option.

## 🎯 Roadmap

- 🌱 **Future Enhancements:**
    - Add nutritional information tracking.
    - Implement recipe suggestions based on user preferences.
    - Allow users to generate shopping lists based on meal plans.
    - Integrate calendar views to filter and sort meals by week.
